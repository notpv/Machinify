# Machinify - Machinery Management Module

A comprehensive mobile-first machinery management application for infrastructure companies. Built with Flutter and Supabase, featuring offline capabilities, QR code scanning, and real-time insights.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Add Machinery**: Register new machines with photos and auto-generated QR codes
- **Log Usage & Fuel**: Track machine usage, fuel consumption, and operator details
- **Movement Tracking**: Record and track machine movements between sites with GPS

### Advanced Features
- **Offline Mode**: Full offline functionality with automatic sync when online
- **QR Code Integration**: Generate and scan QR codes for quick machine identification
- **Fuel Efficiency Validation**: Automatic alerts for unusual fuel consumption patterns
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Manager insights with fuel trends, downtime, and cost analysis
- **Multi-language Support**: English and Hindi localization
- **Voice Input**: Voice-to-text for remarks and operator names
- **Geolocation**: GPS tracking for movement verification

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (Flutter)
- **Framework**: Flutter 3.10+ with Dart
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for clean architecture
- **Offline Storage**: Hive for local data persistence
- **UI/UX**: Material Design 3 with high-contrast outdoor visibility

### Backend (Supabase)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for photos and documents
- **Real-time**: Live updates for movements and logs

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.10+
- Dart SDK 3.0+
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Supabase account

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machinify.git
   cd machinify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Supabase**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Update `lib/utils/constants.dart` with your Supabase URL and anon key
   - Run the migration files in the Supabase SQL editor

4. **Generate Hive adapters**
   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   ```

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables
- **sites**: Construction sites with GPS coordinates
- **machines**: Heavy machinery with QR codes and assignments
- **usage_logs**: Daily usage and fuel consumption records
- **movements**: Machine transfers between sites

### Key Features
- Automatic fuel efficiency calculation
- Machine site assignment updates via triggers
- Data validation and constraints
- Comprehensive indexing for performance

## 🔐 Security

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- **Role-based access control** (Manager vs Field Engineer)
- **JWT authentication** with Supabase Auth
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Offline data encryption** with Hive

## 📊 Analytics & Reporting

### Manager Dashboard
- Machine utilization rates
- Fuel consumption trends
- Movement tracking and costs
- Operator performance metrics
- Maintenance alerts and scheduling

### Field Engineer Interface
- Quick machine lookup via QR scan
- Simple usage logging forms
- Offline-first data entry
- Voice input capabilities

## 🌐 Offline Capabilities

- **Full offline functionality** for all core features
- **Automatic sync** when connectivity is restored
- **Conflict resolution** for concurrent edits
- **Local data persistence** with Hive
- **Sync status indicators** and manual sync options

## 🎯 User Roles

### Field Engineer
- Add and update machinery
- Log daily usage and fuel consumption
- Record machine movements
- Scan QR codes for quick access

### Manager
- All field engineer capabilities
- Access to analytics dashboard
- View all sites and machines
- Generate reports and insights
- Monitor fuel efficiency and costs

## 🚀 Deployment

### Mobile App
```bash
# Android
flutter build apk --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release
```

### Supabase Backend
1. Create Supabase project
2. Run migration files in order
3. Configure RLS policies
4. Set up Storage buckets
5. Enable Realtime for live updates

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
```

### Performance Testing
- Tested with 1000+ machines and 10,000+ logs
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Efficient offline sync mechanisms

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- **Database indexing** on frequently queried columns
- **Lazy loading** for large datasets
- **Image compression** for photos
- **Efficient sync algorithms** for offline data
- **Memory management** for large lists

## 🌍 Localization

Currently supports:
- English (default)
- Hindi

To add more languages:
1. Add locale to `supportedLocales` in `main.dart`
2. Create translation files in `lib/l10n/`
3. Update `AppLocalizations` class
